- 23 classic design patterns (divided  into 3 homework)
	- Creational
	- Behavioral
	- Structural 

(below are some of the design patterns)

**Creational**
- _Abstract Factory_: Provides an interface for creating related objects without specifying concrete classes
- **Builder:** separates object construction from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations 
- **Factory Method:** Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate 
- **Prototyping:** specifies the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance and creates new objects 
- **Singleton:**  ensures a  class has only one instance and provides a global point 

**Structural**:
- _Adapter_: Converts the interface of a class into  another interface the client expects 
- _Bridge_: Decouples an abstraction from implementation  so the two can vary independently 
- _Composite_: Composes objects   into  tree structures  to represent  part-whole hierarchies 
- _Decorator_: Dynamically adds responsibilities  to objects by wrapping  them 
- _Facade_: provides a simplified interface to a library, framework, or complex set of classes
- _Flyweight_: uses sharing to support large numbers of similar objects efficiently
- _Proxy:_ provides a surrogate for  another  object to control access to it 

**Behavioral:**
- _chain of responsibility_: avoids coupling sender and receiver 
- _command_: encapsulates a request as an object allowing it to be queued, logged etc.
- _interpreter:_  implements a specialized language
