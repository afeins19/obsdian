Requirements specify **What to Build** not how to build it 
- describe the problem not the solution
- reflect system design not software design (not programming jargon)
# One Person's "What" is another's "How"
it's important to choose what level of abstraction is needed to make your requirements understandable to a given audience.  

(MIT 6.1010 - software design)
# Requirement Roles
- customers: contractual base 
- managers: scheduling and monitoring 
- designers: a spec to design the system 
- coders: a. range of acceptable implementations 
- qa/testers: basis for testing, verification 

# How to elicit Requirements
- talk to users
- ask questions throughout the process -- "dig" for requirements
- think about why users do something in your app, not just what
- Allow (and **expect**) requirements to change later 
# Requirements Classification
**Functional:** i/o behavior
**Non-Functional:** security, privacy, scalability
**Additional Constraints**: programming language, frameworks, testing infrastructure
# Challenges and Common Mistakes 
## Challenges
- unclear scope and unclear requirements
- changing/evolving requirements
- finding the right balance for presentation (depends on customer):
	- comprehensive vs detailed
	- graphics vs tables and explicit/precision
	- short and timely vs complete and late
## Feature Creep 
- gradual accumulation of features over time
- often has a negative overall effect on a large software project
