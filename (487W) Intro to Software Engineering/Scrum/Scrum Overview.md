- focuses on teamwork (iteration planning and progress reviews)
- Framework does **not** tell developers how to do their work (unlike XP) 
# Structure of  Scrum
- development is keyed to iterations, called  sprints
- rules  of scrum specify planning  and review events during  a sprint 
- sprints and events are **time  boxed**
- Scrum also specifies roles and artifacts 
# Roles  
-  Product Owner  (individual not team)
- Developers 
- Scrum Master
## Product Owner
- generates ideas and manages general direction of sprints

##  Developers
- have  flexibility to  choose how they  implement work items
- developers deliver potentially shippable product "increments" per sprint 

## Scrum Master
- coach (servant-leader)
- organizes and moderates all events 
- keeps events on track

## **--- WE NEED SOME LEVEL OF STRUCTURE ---**
- too much flexibility leads to inefficiency and falling behind 
## Requirements 
	how do we add requirements as the project evolves? What are the mininmum features we need to support the project we're working on. 
# Scrum Process
Product backlog -> sprint backlog -> product increment -> sprint review -> retrospective
- repeat process for  next sprint 
## Daily Scrum 
-  each dev answers the following questions
	-  what did i do yesterday?
	- what did i do today?
	- obstacles?
- Scrum master takes responsibility for removing any external obstacles 
# Sprint  Retrospective
- roughly every 2-3 weeks to evaluate team progress 
- plan **process improvements** for the next sprint 
- this event is **not** about the product 

must have > should have > could have > wont have

# Github Integration 
-  Kanban  integration built in to github **must make your repository a project**
