# Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning (SL) is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. 

In normal circumstances the user provides the computer with a function and some input values. In supervised learning, the user provides some input and output pairs to the computer and the computer must infer the function! 
## Some examples
- hand writing recognition
- computer vision
# Unsupervised Learning 
unsupervised learning relies only on input data. These algorithms learn patterns from untagged data. We want the computer to find some patterns in the data. 
## Some Examples
- YouTube recommendation algorithm 
# Reinforcement Learning 
reinforcement learning is the area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take action in order to maximize the notion of maximum reward. 
## Some examples
- game playing algorithms 
# Deep Learning 
inspired by the biology of the human brain and uses neural networks to learn. the closest idea to a true AI.  
## Godfathers of Deep Learning
- Yoshua Bengio
- Geoffrey Hinton
- Yann LeCun
