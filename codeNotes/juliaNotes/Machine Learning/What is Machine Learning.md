# Foundation of AI 
intelligence demonstrated by machines as opposed to humans or animals. Artificial intelligence formed in Dartmouth in 1956 during which a workshop was organized by John McCarthy. 

AI had a slow beggining as moving beyond trivial results was slow and did not show promise. The most recent big AI boom happened cerca 2010 (if we go by investor interest). 

# Deep Learning
a subset of AI that utilizes Neural Networks. The most exciting part today!

# What is machine learning?
the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience. these algorithms build a model based on sample (training) data and make decisions without being explicitly told to do so.

- ML learns and predicts based on passive observations
- AI implies an agent interacting with the environment 

# so in short...
ML is just a field of algorithms that do the above tasks. They are grouped into various categories. Broadly, we divide them into **Supervised, Unsupervised, and reinforcement Learning Algorithms**
