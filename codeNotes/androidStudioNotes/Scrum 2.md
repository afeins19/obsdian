# Things id like to discuss

# Defining Best Product and Unit Price
- [ ] Finding "best product" by unit price (due to quantity differences...cheapest could mean worse deal than savings on unit price)
	- [ ] could define best as lowest unit price
# Web Scraping
- [ ] Web scraping is very time and resource intensive 
	single zipcode db: 10sec/search x 70 items x 3 stores = 35min run time
	- [ ] could look into requesting "low-data" version of site for quicker loading 
	- [ ] spoofing multiple ips? 
	- [ ] running multiple instances of scraper? 
# Item Comparison 
- [ ] Comparing Items - if user searches "chicken" we may be comparing chicken thighs to chicken breast...not the same item
	- [ ] set "default" items chicken = chicken breast
# Gradle Issues
- [ ] look into how to keep our gradles synced across all branches to prevent merge conflicts
