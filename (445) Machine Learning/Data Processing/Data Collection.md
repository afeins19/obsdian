# Data Collection
gathering raw data from various sources with the objective of using it for analysis and decision making
- manual data entries
- online surveys
- extracting information from documents and databases 
- capturing signals from sensors and more 

# Data Integration 
Converting raw data collections scattered across the systems into a single schema and consolidates them in a unified repository.  

# Data ingestion  
-  Taking data from several sources and moving it to a target system without any  
transformation.  
- A part of data integration or a separate process aiming at transporting information in its  initial form.  

# Data types (for collection)
### Structured Data
- well organized information deliberately placed in tables with columns and rows 
- transaction with time of purchase, location, etc. for example
- easily searchable and occupy minimal storage space
- stored in **relational or sql databases**

### Semi-Structured 
- not as strictly formatted as tabular but preserving identifiable elements 
- JSON, CSV, XML files
