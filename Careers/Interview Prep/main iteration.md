# Introduction
~45 seconds

Major areas of expertise include full-stack development, database architecture, and **data driven optimization**. This encompasses:
- Developing enterprise and user applications using a range of web, form, and mobile frameworks.
- Designing and optimizing databases (with a focus on **ETL** processes and **data integration** workflows)
- Applying data science techniques to real-world problems using: 
	- neural networks
	- **Analysis tools for processing large data sets**
		- excel 
		- DataWrangler 

###  Include From Job Description
- I was also very happy to see that your team is creating scripts for automating processes. This is something i have experience with and I love:
	- **PowerAutomate** 
	- **Visio (Designing ETL Workflows)**
    - using **python**, bash/zsh, docker, yaml etc

# UHS (Most Recent Experience)

### My experience at UHS
As you can see from my resume, I've had the pleasure of working for UHS before on the Automation and Integration team: 

During my time, I led a project to modernize the internal revenue cycle reporting platform to develop interactive PowerBI reports - specifically **Aging Reports**. These reports allowed users to easily sort and filter data across multiple parameters, enabling flexible analysis and access to historical trends over time.

Another key responsibility involved creating and debugging SSIS packages to support ETL processes, ensuring accurate delivery of business metrics to executives, financial analysts, and investors. 

Additionally I utilized C# and the .NET framework to develop client applications (there are more details availiable on that in my resume). 
#### How I did it 
**"If you would like to know the tools I used to do this..."**
This project involved reverse- engineering legacy reports and creating SQL stored procedures to automate data processing for instant access to all historical data.

- How large is your team? 
- What traits do you look for in a good UHS employee?
- Can you elaborate a bit on what kind of tasks your team is looking to automate using scripts and what the preferred scripting language is?  
- What are some challenges youâ€™ve faced integrating processes with external vendors, and how has your team approached solving them?

# When can you start? 
I could start tomorrow but realistically I am looking to start some time mid - January 

# Pay Expectations (only if they ask)
Based on the current market and my skill set 

# Closing Words

I also want to thank you very much for your time today. 


# Additional (if asked)

# PFNonwovens
~ 1 minute

At PFNonwovens, I focused on developing programs to monitor and guide the real-time startup process for medical-grade non-woven material assembly lines. These applications provided:
- step-by-step instructions to operators
- flagged incorrect parameter settings
- designed for future scalability and adaptability to new products. 

Optimization efforts centered on "golden runs" using historical sensor data analysis to maximize the production of high quality product.

### (Optional) Linear Regression
Dependent Variable: Post-production analysis of material.
Independent Variables: Machinery parameters (temperature, speed, pressure, etc.).
Methodology: Collaborated with domain experts (my boss, process engineers, etc.) to select key machinery parameters to perform regression on.
