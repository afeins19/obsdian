# UHS (Most Recent Experience)
~1 minute, 30 seconds
During my time at UHS, I led a project to modernize the internal revenue cycle reporting platform developing highly interactive PowerBI reports with flexible data visualization for querying multiple facilities across various reporting cycles. This project involved reverse- engineering legacy reports and creating SQL stored procedures to automate data processing for instant access to all historical data.
Another key responsibility involved creating and debugging SSIS packages to support critical ETL processes, ensuring accurate delivery of business metrics to executives, financial analysts, and investors. Additionally, I utilized C# and the .NET framework to develop tailored client applications. Specifically, creating utility tools designed to streamline specific tasks and improve operational efficiency.

# PFNonwovens
~ 1 minute
At PFNonwovens, I focused on developing programs to monitor and guide the real-time startup process for medical-grade non-woven material assembly lines. These applications provided

step-by-step instructions to operators, flagged incorrect parameter settings, and were designed for future scalability and adaptability to new products. Optimization efforts centered on "golden runs" using historical sensor data analysis to maximize the production of high quality product.

(Optional) Linear Regression
Dependent Variable: Post-production analysis of material.
Independent Variables: Machinery parameters (temperature, speed, pressure, etc.).
Methodology: Collaborated with domain experts (my boss, process engineers, etc.) to select key machinery parameters to perform regression on.
