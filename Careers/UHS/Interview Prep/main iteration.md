# Introduction
~45 seconds

Major areas of expertise include full-stack development, database architecture, and data driven optimization. This encompasses:
- Developing enterprise and user applications using a range of web, form, and mobile frameworks.
- Designing and optimizing databases, with a focus on ETL processes and data integration workflows.
- Applying data science techniques to real-world problems using: 
	- neural networks
	- data aggregation  & analysis tools 
		- excel
		- python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) 

###  Include From Job Description
- I was also very happy to see that your team is creating scripts for automating processes. This is something i have experience with and I love doing:
	- Visio & PowerAutomate 
    - using python, bash/zsh, docker, yaml etc.

### My experience at UHS
this experience was incredible and I am happy to be interviewing here.
 - great team (Automation and Integration) 

During my time at UHS, I led a project to modernize the internal revenue cycle reporting platform to develop interactive PowerBI reports. These reports allowed users to easily sort and filter data across multiple parameters, enabling flexible analysis and  access to historical trends over time.

Another key responsibility involved creating and debugging SSIS packages to support critical ETL processes, ensuring accurate delivery of business metrics to executives, financial analysts, and investors. Additionally, I utilized C# and the .NET framework to develop tailored client applications. Specifically, creating utility tools designed to streamline specific tasks and improve operational efficiency.

#### How I did it 
**"If you would like to know the tools I used to do this..."**
This project involved reverse- engineering legacy reports and creating SQL stored procedures to automate data processing for instant access to all historical data.

# PFNonwovens
~ 1 minute

At PFNonwovens, I focused on developing programs to monitor and guide the real-time startup process for medical-grade non-woven material assembly lines. These applications provided

step-by-step instructions to operators, flagged incorrect parameter settings, and were designed for future scalability and adaptability to new products. Optimization efforts centered on "golden runs" using historical sensor data analysis to maximize the production of high quality product.

(Optional) Linear Regression
Dependent Variable: Post-production analysis of material.
Independent Variables: Machinery parameters (temperature, speed, pressure, etc.).
Methodology: Collaborated with domain experts (my boss, process engineers, etc.) to select key machinery parameters to perform regression on.

- I led a team in developing a fully autonomous robot. I delegated work to my team mates and developed the path planning algorithm the robot used.

- I also helped develop an android application to help users find cheap and nearby grocery items optimizing for cost and proximity.

# Questions 
- What are some tools and platforms that your team uses on a day to day basis? 
- Can you elaborate a bit on what kind of tasks your team is looking to automate using scripts and what the preferred scripting language is?  
- What are some challenges youâ€™ve faced integrating processes with external vendors, and how has your team approached solving them?
