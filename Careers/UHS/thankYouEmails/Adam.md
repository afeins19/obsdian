Dear Adam,

 I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your time and the opportunity to meet. It was a pleasure to meet you and gain insight into the important work your team is doing at UHS.

I’m particularly excited about the prospect of contributing my skills in report building, database management, and machine learning to support your team’s mission. I believe that my skills could be useful for extracting data they need and extract meaningful insights to drive informed decisions. 

Thank you again for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of joining your team and contributing to its success. Please feel free to reach out if you need any further information.

Warmly,

Aaron Feinberg
