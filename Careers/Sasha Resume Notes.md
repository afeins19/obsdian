# Summary of Qualifications (Most Important)
- Start with the Product you are producing - the goal, the outcome. Then list the Tools you are using to accomplish this.Don’t use “I” statements. First list out SUBJECTS then list out TOOLS.
- use the terms that the job listings you like use and add them to your resume (especially the **Profound Experience** line)
# Professional Experience 
- no one will be checking EXACTLY what you did - make it sound as good as it can possibly be
- MOVE TOOLS THAT YOU USED TO THE SUMMARY OF QUALIFICATIONS
- have 4-5 bullet point minimum 
- the main focus there should be on **how the work you did created a tangible benefit to the company** and what that benefit was 
- **Never write you're a quick learner or any of those generic lines**

# Academic Projects & Research
highlight **your specific contributions to the project**
- list subject then tools as you did in summary of qualitifcations 
- condense all bullet points in this section to a single bullet point
