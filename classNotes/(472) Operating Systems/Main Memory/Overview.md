- programs must be brought (from disk) into memory and placed within a process for it to be run 
- main memory and registers are the only storage the CPU can access directly
- memory unit only sees a stream of addresses and read requests or address and data + write requests
- cache sits between main memory and cpu registers 

memory itself is not a complicated thing. The complexity comes from the rate of interaction with the cpu. 
#  Memory Hierarchy

### CPU Memory
- working memory for the instruction
- general purpose register for storing operands and pointers
- special purpose register for holding the status of a program such as a program counter 

### Cache Memory
- positioned logically between the cpu registers and main memory 
- special memory that compensates the speed mismatch between processor and main memory access time 
- the cache is usually transparent to programmers 

### Main Memory 
- large and fairly fast external memory used to store programs
- storage locations are addressed directlly by the load and store instructions of the cpu
- two modes
	- static ram - a fast access time to implement cache memory 
		- static storage with power on
	- dynamic ram - high density -> more capacity
		- dynamic refresh to overcome current leakage 

### Secondary Memory 
- very large in capacity
- slowest memory type 

# Address Space 
the logical address space which is the set of all logical addresses generated for a program
- logical address - an individual address within the logical address space **this is generated by the cpu during program execution**
- physical address space
	- the complete set of physical memory addresses that a program can generate during its execution 
	- physical address - the address seen by the memory unit 

### Big Picture

### Base Register
register to specify the smallest physical memory address for a given process 
- lloaded only by the operation system

### Limit Address
register to specify the size of the range of addresses (defines the size of addresses) 
- loaded only by the operation system

### Logical address space
the set of all logical addresses generated by a programs perspective
