# Typethon 
![[type_thon_logo.jpg]]

Python. Its likely one of the first programming languages you learn in University and just as often the go-to language for cutting edge scientific research in laboratories. Why is this? Because Python lets users get their ideas into a program in a streamlined a way as possible! Python is simply unbeatable for teaching and learning conceptual algorithms, creating illustrative and quick scientific notebooks, and serving as a "quick scratch pad" prototyping language. In fact, Python overtook Java at least according to the TIOBE ranking of the most popular programming languages. 

However, despite its widespread adoption and growth, Python has not been the go-to choice for developing large-scale applications. One of the reasons behind this is Python's dynamic typing system, which, while flexible, can lead to runtime errors and challenges in scalability and maintenance in larger codebases. In the experience of many developers, python projects usually start out great but deteriorate in scalability and maintainability as they grow. 

Enter, Typethon a language which combines the safety and reliable performance of static typing, the clear readability of bracketed functions and classes and combines them with pythons already superb expressive richness. No longer will an extra white-space mean your code just doesn't run and no more guessing what types to expect for your function, especially in a complex or open-source project. 

# Static Strong Typing 
In Typethon, the integration of strong static types stands as an evolution from Pythonâ€™s dynamic type system, designed to offer substantial benefits in the development of large-scale applications. By implementing static typing, Typethon ensures type errors are caught at compile-time rather than at runtime, significantly reducing the occurrence of common bugs and enhancing code reliability. This feature is particularly beneficial in complex projects where the type of a variable can become ambiguous, leading to errors that are difficult to trace in a dynamically typed setting.

### Enhanced Autocomplete 
As developers write code, IDE can provide more relevant suggestions based on the variable types and method signatures. This not only speeds up the coding process but also reduces the likelihood of errors, as developers are less likely to use an incorrect type or method. Its clear that types serve a crucial role in modern programming languages. 

### Reliable Refactoring 
Given Pythons modularity and ease of use and importation of libraries, its clear why developers love it. The ability to separate concerns in one's code is a great practice and is one of the central tenants of the SOLID principle. However, with large scale projects and especially in those with many developers, it is difficult to reliably track how a refactored function may impact other functions or objects that rely on it. With static typing, it will be easier to see and trace potential type mismatches allowing for a safer and more efficient restructuring process. 

# Embracing Curly Braces
A distinctive feature of Typethon, setting it apart from Python, is its adoption of curly braces `{}` to define code blocks, a departure from Python's indentation-based structure. This transition represents more than a mere cosmetic change. It addresses several challenges associated with large-scale software development. 

Pythons indentation based code-sectioning is a common gripe among developers and although it may seem trivial, the implementation of brackets into python has immense on error reduction and code consistency across IDEs and even individual developer profiles! 

### Error Reduction
One of the common pitfalls with indentation is the potential for errors due to inconsistent spacing or tab usage, which can be challenging to spot, especially in large codebases. Curly braces eliminate this issue, reducing the likelihood of such syntax errors and enhancing overall code quality.

### Tooling and Automation
Curly braces also lend themselves well to automated tooling, such as code formatters and linters. These tools can more reliably parse and restructure code, ensuring consistent coding standards are maintained across the project. This automated enforcement of coding standards is particularly beneficial in large-scale projects where manual code review can be cumbersome. 

### Enhanced Readability
indentation makes nested code a nightmare to look through sometimes. Imagine a python class with a function that contains an if statement. This simple rudimentary code structure already involves 3 whole levels of indentation! Curly braces offer a readability boost for developers that don't want have to spin their mouse scroll wheels up and down all day. 

# Try Typethon!
In conclusion, Typethon emerges as a formidable new entrant in the programming language arena, addressing critical pain points faced by developers working on large-scale applications. By combining the expressive power and simplicity of Python with the robustness of static typing and the  clarity of curly braces, Typethon offers a compelling synthesis of productivity and performance.
