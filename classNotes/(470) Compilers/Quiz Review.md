1. **why are there so many programming languages?**
	because new technologies come out like Databases, the internet, cloud etc. we create new languages to allow people to create programs to make use of these. Programming languages are also created based on what programmer want (OOP for example). Other reasons are domain specifics warranting a specific language
2. **What is a good programming language?** 
	there really is no good answer to this question. The need determines the language. 
3. **Why is one programming language better than another?****
	- performance, 
	- ease of use 
	- Also note that many languages mimic other programming languages so reduce training time. Also, note the available libraries for a given language. 
4. **There are thousands of programming languages out there today****
5. **Is designing and implementing a new language harder than teaching it?**
	no
7. **Match the language to its domain**
	**fortran** - scientific computing
	**sql** - database
	**c/c++** - systems programming 
	**java** - internet programming language 
8. **Front end compiler**
	a piece of software that takes the sources code and produces a data structure called a parsing tree 
9. **what are the steps of creating a programming language?** 
	-  you have to start by defining some type of grammar
	- understanding call by value vs call by reference 
		- call by value requires the use of calling functions with a copy of the defined parameter where as a reference just references the single lone created copy
