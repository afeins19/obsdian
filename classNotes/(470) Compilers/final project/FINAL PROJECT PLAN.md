- [x] Figure out why variables aren't being added to the symbol table in main.py 
- [ ] enforce type rules
	- [x] in variable assignment make sure type matches type of the value
	- [x] operations on variables must only work on variables with the same type (otherwise they error)
	- [x] functions 
		- [x] ensure that the value returned by a function matches its return type 
		- [x] ensure that the arguments passed into the function match the type in its definition

```c#
public int add2(int x){
	return x + 2
}
	
```


# Binding Problem
- res.register_advancement()  - might be something to look into 


var_type == value_type
