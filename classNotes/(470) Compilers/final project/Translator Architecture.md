### 1. **Lexical Analysis (Lexer)**

The lexer is responsible for converting the input source code into a stream of tokens. It handles basic text processing, including skipping whitespace and comments, recognizing different token types such as integers, floats, strings, and various operators.

**Key Features**:

- **Token Identification**: Recognizes various types of tokens including keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators, and delimiters.
- **Comment Skipping**: Ignores comments in the code to focus on syntactically significant elements.
- **Advanced Position Tracking**: Maintains detailed information about the current position in the source code, which aids in detailed error reporting.

### 2. **Syntax Analysis (Parser)**

The parser takes the stream of tokens from the lexer and constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the program's structure. It handles various programming constructs like expressions, variable assignments, control flow statements (if, for, while), and function definitions.

**Key Features**:

- **Parsing Expressions and Statements**: Builds AST nodes for different types of expressions and statements, ensuring the syntactic structure of the input code is correctly formed.
- **Error Handling**: Capable of recognizing syntax errors and providing useful error messages, helping developers understand mistakes in the source code.
- **Control Flow Constructs**: Handles complex constructs like loops and conditional statements, integrating them into the AST.

### 3. **Nodes (AST Nodes)**

Nodes represent the elements of the abstract syntax tree. Each node type corresponds to a particular construct in the programming language, such as arithmetic operations, variable access, and control structures.

**Node Types**:

- **Expression Nodes**: Represent operations and evaluations, such as binary operations, unary operations, and variable assignments.
- **Control Flow Nodes**: Represent if conditions, loops, and function definitions, capturing the logical flow of the program.
- **Utility Nodes**: Such as nodes for handling lists of statements, which are useful for blocks of code in functions and control structures.

### 4. **Parse Results**

This component encapsulates the outcome of parsing operations. It can hold a successfully parsed node or information about an error that occurred during parsing. This allows the parser to either continue processing or handle errors appropriately.

**Features**:

- **Error Tracking**: Records errors that occur during parsing, allowing the parser to backtrack or halt as needed.
- **Node Management**: Stores nodes that represent parsed elements of the code, facilitating the construction of a complete AST.

### Integration and Workflow

- **From Text to Tokens**: The lexer reads the raw input text and converts it into tokens based on the syntax rules defined for identifiers, keywords, literals, and operators.
- **Token to AST**: The parser reads these tokens, validates them according to the grammar rules of the language, and constructs an AST.
- **Error Handling**: Both lexer and parser are equipped to handle and report errors, which helps in debugging and improving the code written by the user.
