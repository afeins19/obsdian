	this final project will be composed out components that will be constructed by certain milestones throughout this course. This will cullminate into a finished programming language.

# Designing your own Programming Language
- what niche will your language fill?
- what reserved keywords will it use? 
- what is your target platform? 

# Making a Computer Language

### Steps 
	from a high level, this is the usual progression 
1. Define the Grammar
2. Build the front-end compiler for the source code
3. Build the back-end code generator (optional in this course)

## Front-end Compiler 
	a piece of software that takes the source code and produces some weird looking data structure 

## Back-end Compiler
	another piece of software that takes the output of the front-end compiler and creates an executable from it.
