- llama llm
- rankchain (tool for training llm)
- we are going with topic 2
	- start with time series analysis
	- move to space-time series analysis 
- idea is to use llms with good prompt engineering or in combination with deep learning nn's to make better predictions of numeric data in time series analysis 

### Tools (get familliar)
- smaller versions of state of the art openai for training (models)
- pytorch 
- tensorflow 
- Huggingface 

### To learn 
- pytorch (janghoon will send a tutorial collab)
- tensorflow (well use less frequently)
- huggingface
