"""Recursion Functions:
    Heuristic: if a problem can be broken down into smaller identical pieces, recursion may be used to solve a problem
    (apart from being an elegant solution, some functions may only be solved recursively)

Laws Of Recursion:
    1. base case (terminating condition)
    2. function must change states and move towards the base case
    3. recursive call (function calls itself)

Types of Recursive Functions:

    Direct Recursive: simply a function that calls itself

    Indirect Recursive: A calls B and B calls A

    Mutually Recursive: A chain of calls which terminates back at base case
