# Branch vs. Clone vs. Fork 

## Branch
- main development branch
- adding a new feature, fixing a bug etc. **Create a new branch**
- Light weight branching **(branch)**
- Heavy weight branching (**Clone**)
- Clone + Metadata (**Fork**)

## Conflicts
- conflicts arise when two users **change the same line** of a file 
- when a conflict arises, the last committer needs to resolve it 

# Merging
## Merge vs. Rebase 

- Merging combines branches together
- rebase sets the main to the feature branch 
	- sequential commit history 
	- **changes the commit history**

## Merging into main Procedure
1. checkout main branch 
2. git merge "branch_name"

# Github 
- issues - separate functionality to document issues to be resolved
