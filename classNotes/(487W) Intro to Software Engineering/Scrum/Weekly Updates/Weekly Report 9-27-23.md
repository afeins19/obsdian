## Previous Goal
my goal this week was to finish configuring my android studio environment and complete the first few sections of an android studio development course. In order to practice what i have learned, Syed and I have been working on the "Startup"  branch...creating some example activities. I created  the "About" activity for  our app with  an XML file and button on the main activity which directs you there. 

## Key Points
- Creating MVP for our app in android studio
- documenting the process
- learning to use android studio 

##  Goal  For Next Week 
Along with continuing to learn the android studio environment, I would like to start adding documentation to GitHub about the android studio development process. I will also include a small blurb about gradle as i just found out it is the tool which automatically gets dependencies one may need to run our program. I would also like to get through the next 2 sections of my Udemy course.
