## Software Development: ad-hoc approach

### Pros of ad-hoc
- no formal process
- easy quick and flexible

### Cons of ad-hoc
- lacks important tasks such as design or testing
- doesn't scale to multiple developers
- **difficult to measure effort and progress**

# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
	produces software through a series of stage (conception to end of life)

## Goals for each stage
- define a clear set of **actions** to perform
- produce **tangible (trackable)** items
- allow for **work revision**
- **plan actions** to perform in the next stage 

## Stages of SDLC (Waterfall Model)
1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Maintenance (how open source companies profit) 

## Waterfall method 
### Pros
- easy to follow
- reviews ensure readiness to advance
- works well for well defined projects (clear requirements)

### Cons 
- hard to do all planning upfront 
- final product may not match clients needs 
- step reviews require significant effort 

## Prototyping method 
- bottom up approach
- problem domain or requirments need not be understood 
- create small implementations of requirements that are atleast understood 
- requirements change as product develops 

## Agile Models
	allows for breaking down of the project into small components for small teams or individuals to work on. Requires good management team to steer and consolidate work 
### Pros 
- flexibility 
- focus on quality (continuous changes)
- focus on communication

### Cons 
- requires experienced management and highly skilled developers
- prioritizing requirements an be difficult when there are multiple stakeholders
- best for small to medium sub projects
