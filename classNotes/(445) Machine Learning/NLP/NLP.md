natural language is the way in which humans communicate with each other 

### Why is it hard?
it is a messy process
- human language is very ambiguous 
- changing and evolving terms 
- few rules 

Natural language is designed to make human communication efficient 
- we omit a lot of common sense knowledge with the assumption that the hearer/reader posses this knowledge 
- we keep a lot of ambiguities with the assumption that the hearer/reader knows how to resolve 
# Encoding 
we need to encode the data into a form that computers can understand - we apply a scheme called **character** encoding 

### Encoding Schemes 
a way to represent a character in binary. An encoding must follow a specific character set - for example UTF 

### Code Point 
a decimal value associated with a character in a character set 
- atomic unit of information
**text is just a sequence of code points**. Note that code points are not to be directly used in text, its just a representational format. 

### Universal Encodings 
- unicode - universally coded character set 
- Unicode Transformation Format (UTF)
