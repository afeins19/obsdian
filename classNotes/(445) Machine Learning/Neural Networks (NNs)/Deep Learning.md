Deep learning is essentially just a Large Neural Network.. It may also be defined as **Hierarchical Feature Learning**. This means that the algorithm automatically has the ability to discover and learn good representations of the data using feature learning. 
- makes learning algorithms much better and easier to use
- performance just keeps getting better as we feed in more data 
### Why Deep Learning? 
- deep implies large number of layers
- the model will converge onto better performance simply by increasing the training data

the benefit of deep learning is that, given enough data, we don't really need to worry about feature engineering. The network will itself extract the most relevant features during training. 

In theory, deep learning neural networks (CNNs) form a representation of features from low-level to high-level as we move through more and more layers.
