an algorithm based on Bayes Theorem, it's used for learning and classification. It uses **prior** probability of each category given no further other information about an item. Categorization produces a **posterior** probability distribution over the possible categories given a description of some item. 

# Example: Dice 
the basic example involves rolling a pair of dice 
- **trial** - an experiment 
- **outcome** - an ordered pair of numbers representing the dice values for each trial 
- **Sample space** - the set of all possible outcomes in some experiment given by $\Omega$
- **Event** - any subset of the sample space 

# Probability Distribution
a mapping between the set of all events and the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. It may be a function if the probability of some event t maps to one and only one value every event.
