|McGill Curl-Up|2x10|you can also start with 6/4/2|
|Side Plank|3x20 seconds, 2x20 seconds, 1x20 seconds (per side).|So e.g., 3x20 on one side, with about 10 seconds between, then switch to the other side and do 3x20, then rest a minute, then 2x20, etc.|

Plank/Side Plank  
[Bird dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgOuR7YrwtM) - I actually do this with a 10 second pause at extension, and instead of coming back to the start, I touch my knee and hand together, which is called "sweeping". The goal here is to bring your hips and shoulder through a range of motion while bracing and stabilizing, specifically maintaining neutral in the lumber, and not twisting in the hips.

[Half-kneeling cable wood-chop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceDvPX6hP_U) - the bar attachment can be substituted for a rope attachment, and I've also done this with a band. When doing this, keep your glutes activated, and lumbar neutral.
