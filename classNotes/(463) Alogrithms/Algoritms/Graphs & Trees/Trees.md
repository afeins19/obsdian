We can partition graphs into trees which might occur in certain graphs. 

- **Spanning tree** - a tree with the min number of edges between all vertices 
- **MST** - if the edges of a a graph are weighted, the MST represents the tree with the lowest edge costs which is also a spanning tree  

# Graph Traversal
represents the process of visiting each vertex in the graph exactly once 

### DFS
- uses a stack as the collection in the generic algorithm
- adds a new node to the stack and recursively traverses its neighbors 

### BFS
- uses a queue to visit nodes in the generic algorithm 
- the queue allows us to visit each node in a given layer of a graph before moving on to the next layer
