# What is deep learning? 
a subset of machine learning, deep learning is a technique that learns features and tasks directly from the data. 

### Machine Learning (NN) vs. Deep Learning 
machine learning requires a feature extraction step to be performed - we must figure out what features are relevant to focus on and create metrics for the algorithm to score how relevant the feature are for a given test sample. 

Deep learning uses algorithms to determine what features of a particular image are useful.

# AlexNet
AlexNet is a pretrained CNN that has been trained on about 1.2 million images from the ImageNet dataset 
- 23 layers 
- can classify images into 1000 object categories 
- MATLAB can access Alexnet directly 
- requires the **deep learning tooolbox** 
### Inference 
using the trained NN weights to perform an analysis -> this just means using a trained network to classify an image
