# Goal 
Develop and test a Matlab script to control a robot and ensure that it keeps a black line within the center of its camera image at all times. The script should generate commands for the robot to move based on where the line is on the image 

### Problem Statement
There are 3 input images provided by the instructor (see next slide). For each image given, the program should display one of 3 possible outputs (“go straight”, “turn right”, “turn left”). Show test cases clearly. There will be 3 test cases (the 3 images given).
