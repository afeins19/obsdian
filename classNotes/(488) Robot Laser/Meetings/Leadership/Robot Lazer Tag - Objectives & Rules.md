- [ ] Try and remove any cheap exploits to keep the game interesting
	- [ ] camping at a particular area
	- [ ] continuous use of laser 
	- [ ] ramming/blocking 
- [ ] Define the minimum requirements that each robot needs to have
	- [ ] ex: amount and configuration of light receivers to detect hits from other robot's lasers
- [ ] Brainstorm/Discuss any initial concerns
	- [ ] Bluetooth signal degredation through obstacles
	- [ ] Lidar in center may not give a great view of the filed


# Possible New ideas for game setup

### Section 1 vs. Section 2
Each section will feature 3 robots from their respective teams. These robots will work together to accomplish some goal. Either classic laser tag with the opposing section or the current setup of the game on Joe Oakes's diagram

### LIDar on the disruptor bot
have the lidar be on the disruptor bot of each section, meaning that we will need to have 2 LIDar all together. Using the disruptor bots position and the continuous LIDar scan, each robot will receive a continuously updated stream of data about its environment.
