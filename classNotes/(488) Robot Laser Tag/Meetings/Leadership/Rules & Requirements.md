- robot shouldn't crash
- robot should be able to switch into disruptor mode 
- robot must fire a laser 

- robot being disabled after the target is hit
- robot target sensors should all be accessible 

# Updating Requirements (Question for Joe)
- Remove the requirement that the robot be a humanoid and allow "tank" style robots - a single laser turret mounted on top
- Removing the requirement for hardware based shields
	- shields will be emulated with software - robot that deploys a shield will not have hits on its target counted for some duration of time 

# Justification 
- Tank Style - can we have creative freedom with the overall design of the robot?
- Shield - we really like this idea. However, the software solution for this might be more feasible. If time is available, we will try to implement a hardware solution for this.


# Design Document 
*Due October 6th (Sunday) - ideally completed by October 5th (Saturday)*

In the planner I listed out the tasks for the this document and can assign them or you guys can feel free to grab the ones you want. There are instructional videos at the bottom explaining each component of the design document and how to make them. Draw.io is a good place to make these but if anyone knows a better resource please feel free to post it.
