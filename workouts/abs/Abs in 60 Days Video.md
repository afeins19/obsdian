### Body Fat
In order to have visible abs, one must have a body fat percentage of between 20% and 10% (men). 
# Training 
like any other muscle group, in order to increase muscle mass in your abs, you have to cause hypertrophy (no pain no gain). The most effective exercise approach for your abs is **progressive overloading** - loading the ab muscles with weight. Below are the two main exercises needed to build your abs: 

### Weighted Crunch (Cable Crunch)
kneel down and crunch allowing your lower back to round. Don't use your arms obviously. This exercise generally hits the entire 6-pack but slightly emphasizes the upper 4-pack

**Volume:** 3 sets x 10-12 reps 
**Frequency:** 2x/week 
**Intensity:** last set until failure

### Leg Raises
Best method -> Do in a roman chair (the thing with the pull-up handles and dip handles). These tone the lower 2-pack section of your abs. 

Volume:** 3 sets x 10-20 reps 
**Frequency:** 2x/week 
**Intensity:** last set until failure

**Tips**:
- each week increase the number of reps by 1 starting with 10 reps on week 1
