1) the hard work of breaking the habit, because to some extent feeling stupid _is_ just habit. It's a reflex. You're used to it. So you have to catch yourself getting angry and say, 'No, I'm not going to do it'. You'll _want_ to do it  it will feel like you _have_ to just to feel better. But what will happen is if you do none of those things you'll feel better anyway.

2) you have gained something very few achieve. You know what its like to have faced abject failure. You tried incredibly hard and failed and while it hurts you should feel good in knowing two things: one, you only failed right now and going forward you can do better. And two, you know what it feels like to fail.

3) You’re too attached to those feelings. You need to distance yourself from the addiction of external validation. Everyone has those thoughts, and as a stoic I observe them but do not dwell on them for I know that they are fleeting. You are not your thoughts, so you only take responsibility for them by becoming attached even by accident.
	- Next time you have these feelings remember it as a byproduct of your brain being a reactionary muscle. It’s purpose is to think about everything it encounters. If you can distance yourself from the thoughts, you’ll find that you can trace the emotional attachment to the train of thought through your history and alter your behavior and remove the attachment you do not desire to keep. Once you perform this once you’ll find it becomes easier over time.
