# Meeting Notes
Meeting with Dr. Scary went fairly well. I think i was pretty thorough and the write up i provided him seemed to capture my thoughts pretty well I feel. We are still approaching this with the goal of treating depression and I'm not sure if that's exactly the right approach for me, however he did tell me that we haven't tried too many things yet and would hesitate to label me treatment resistant which is good news I think. With the amount they are charging I should have definitely thought of going with someone with a bit more experience/expertise with my specific issues but I am willing to continue with him for now. 
- went over the write up that I made for our initial meeting ([[symptoms]])
- he got a general history from me 
- went over past medications that we tried before 
# New prescriptions 
going to try Prozac (20mg) in addition to the current dose of Concerta (54mg)

- Prozac - 20mg
	- should notice some improvement within 4-6 weeks 
# Notes from the Doctor
- should take roughly 4-6 weeks to notice any changes from the medication 
- have not went up in dose with the other medications (sertraline for example was not tried at a higher dose)
