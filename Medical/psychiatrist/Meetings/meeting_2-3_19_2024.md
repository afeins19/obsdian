# Meeting Notes
I met with Doctor Scary for the second time today. We started by discussing how I am doing and whether or not the medication has made an impact thus far. I told him that I haven't really noticed too much of a change. He confirmed that the I should be looking for improvements in:
- malaise/slog in day to day life
- getting to the gym and other personal commitments 
- feeling more active during the day 

We discussed increasing my dose for the Prozac. We will revaluate how its working roughly 6 weeks from today and have made our next appointment for the 30th of April @ 10am. With regard to the brain fog, he feels that the Prozac should help with that in some way. I asked about increasing the dose of Concerta but he said to wait until we get my dose of the Prozac right first which makes sense. 

# Medication Changes 
we opted to increase my current dose of Fluoxetine (Prozac) from 20mg to 40mg effective today. 

# Next Appointment 
- 6 weeks from now
- towards the end of April 
- **next appt. 4/30 @ 10am**
