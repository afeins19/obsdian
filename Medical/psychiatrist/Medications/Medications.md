Bellow are Medications which i have tried from 2017-2023. Some of the medications were tried together and sometimes cycled, i will try my best to note what medications were being taken in conjunction with each other.  

# Currently Taking 
| Methylpheindate HCI ER | 54mg | currently taking | slightly longer lasting but more tapered effects than Adderall and Vyvanse. |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
# Previous Medications  
| Medication | Dose | Date | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Amantadine | 100mg | 05/17-08/17 | did not do much but would sometimes elicit feelings of sadness (dont remember much more than that). Was stopped because of this. |
| Aripiprazole | 2mg-10mg | 03/20-05/202 | had no noticeable effect. |
| Buproprion HCL XL | 150mg-300mg | 10/17-12/17 (used some time in 2020-2021 too) | felt a bit of an increase in motivation/energy during the first week (when on 300mg) but it stopped working. |
| Dextroamp-amphet ER & IR | 20mg-30mg ER/ 10mg IR (only with 20mg ER) | 9/18- 4/19 | Tried on and off over the years. helped somewhat with lethargy and tiredness throughout he day. Allowed me to sustain effort towards tasks a bit more. Did not help too much with executive functioning issues directly though. |
| Escitalopram | 5mg up to 10mg | 05/17-08/13 | had no noticable effect |
| Guanfacine | 1mg | 08/20-11/21 | had no noticable effect |
| Lamotragine | 25mg | 04/21-10/21 | had no noticable effect |
| Methylpheindate HCI ER | 54mg | on and off but roughly 2 years total time | slightly longer lasting but more tapered effects than Adderall and Vyvanse. **Currently Taking** |
| Sertraline HCL | 50-100mg | 02/18-12/18 | had no noticable effect. I do not remember why I took it for so long. Began titrating down around 12/18 to try other medications |
| Viibryd | 20mg | 11/19-12/19 | had no noticable effect. |
| Vyvance | 10mg-30mg | 05/21-07/21 | Same as Adderall  essentially  |
- amantadine was coupled with escitalopram (i believe) 
- Guanfacine and Lamotragine were used in conjucntion with stimulant and sometimes an antidepressant (wellbutrin)
# Notes
- specifically remember doing homework one day in 4th or 5th grade, was sick and i took cough medicine (Nyquil?). Felt an marked increase in ability to do the work and do it accurately (long division).  Never happened again, but the difference must have been huge given that I remembered it so clearly
- Recent Blood Panels showed nothing out of the ordinary and that i am fine nutritionally/supplementally
