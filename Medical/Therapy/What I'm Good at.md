# 1. I'm a good friend 
- I always try to help them out when my friends are in need 
- I try to see things from other people's perspective 
- I take interest in the lives of my friends 
- although i haven't been keeping in touch as much as i should have, I am working on getting better at it 
# 2. I'm Pretty Good at Coding
- even though some things are still pretty hard i find that i can usually understand certain things well 
- I can do some 4-ku codewars problems 
- even though my solutions are sometimes messy I am usually on the right track and have the underlying solution in mind
