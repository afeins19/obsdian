If you feel the need to relapse, read what you have written here below:

How i feel right now (after edging):
- groggy
- out of it 
- low desire to engage in anything
- apathetic 
# What happens if I Edge or Relapse
- edging/relapsing will make everything else in life seem less interesting and vibrant
- your confidence shoots downwards 
- you feel anxious and less social 
- you literally spend entire DAYS watching porn instead of doing the things that will benefit you 
- you reduce your ability to **derive pleasure** from healthy, meaningful things in life 
- you lose your ability to get turned on by girls
- you lose your desire to seek out relationships 
- you continue to fuck up your dopamine and dopaminergic system 

# What happens if I abstain
- you reduce the neural pathway in your brain that causes the intense urges you feel to watch porn
- you continue to reap the benefits of a healthy dopaminergic system
	- better focus 
	- increased desire to pursue what you want in life 
	- better ability to persevere  
	- increases in executive functioning 
- you continue to improve your ability to face discomfort 
	- this allows you to adhere to your values 
	- this lets you be the person you want to be 
- you slowly but surely introduce other things that your brain will learn to derive pleasure from 
- your task engagement and focus improves 
- you feel "pushed" to do the right thing when you realize you aren't instead of feeling apathetic
