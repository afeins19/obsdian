# Development Needs 

### Continuing to Deepen Business Underestanding 
I am making effort to continue to grow my knowledge of Revenue Cycle as well as our workflows here at UHS. 
By gaining deeper insight into these areas, I'll be able to better tailor our reports
sepcifcally to our end user's needs -- extracting the most meaningful information while filtering out the noise.
With an increased knowledge base, I will be able to better triage new requests and provide constructive
pushback when a request may not align with our priorities.

### Expanding QA Practices
In addition to the improvements in consistency and accuracy gained through automation, I plan to further strengthen the reliability of our data pipelines by incorporating modern testing frameworks and tooling. 
By explicitly defining test cases for our pipelines, we’ll be able to identify potential issues earlier in the development cycle—before deployment. 
This will lead to more dependable data outputs and reduce the number of iterations required to deliver final products.


### Strategic Prioritization 
I’m focused on setting clear weekly priorities and regularly evaluating progress to stay on track and improve delivery timelines. 
While I remain flexible to handle urgent or high-impact requests, I’m committed to maintaining momentum on existing projects. 
This balance between adaptability and structured planning helps reduce context-switching, improve consistency, and ensure alignment with team goals and long-term value.
