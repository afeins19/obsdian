# Observed Strenghts

### System Design
I've developed a strong ability to design efficient and scalable systems. 
Allowing for better automation of our metrics in the future as well as decreasing the development time 
overall for new requests.
Additionally, I actively apply my knowledge of software design and computation to identify inefficiencies and improvements. 
Beyond building whats needed today, 
I stay engaged with the broader data engineering and ETL community to learn the state of the art methods, tools, and processes and actively apply them to my work. 

### Business and Technical Bridge
I am able to translate business requirements into technical specs.
I work closely with end users and leadership to understand the intent behind each reporting request, putting myself
in the user's shoes to optimize my reports and dashboards for them.
I am proactive in communicating with end users to iron out bugs and add new functionalities allowing our departments reports 
and dashboard to evolve with the business needs

### Project Ownership
I take great responsibility over my projects and always apply thoughtfull design throughout the development process. I have demonstrated that I am able independently able to design and implement 
end-to-end systems with the many dashboards I have automated. I treat each project as a long-term asset for our department, always keeping scalability and growth in mind. This has allowed me 
to establish direct relationships with our end users, gain a deep understanding of how the tools we develop are used in practice, and allowed me to connect our reports to the broader business
context.
