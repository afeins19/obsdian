# Observed Strenghts

### System Design
I’ve developed a strong capability for designing efficient, scalable systems that reduce development time and enable future automation of key metrics.
By applying core principles of software design and computation, I proactively identify and eliminate inefficiencies.
Beyond just building whats needed today, 
I stay actively engaged with the broader data engineering and ETL community, 
continuously incorporating state-of-the-art frameworks, tools, and methodologies into my work to ensure our systems remain modern and robust.


### Business-Technical Bridge
I effectively and quicklky translate business requirements into clear and actionable technical specifications.
I work closely with end users and leadership to ensure our reports are intuitive, relevant, and effectively communicate the story behind the data. 
I proactively engage with users to resolve issues and implement new features, 
enabling our reporting tools to evolve in step with the department’s changing needs.


### Project Ownership
I take full ownership of my projects, consistently applying thoughtful design throughout the development process. 
I’ve demonstrated the ability to independently architect and deliver end-to-end systems, 
including the FWIP and CBO Productivity dashboards, among others.
I treat each project as a long-term asset for our department, always keeping scalability and growth in mind. 
By staying engaged throughout the development lifecycle, I’ve built strong relationships with users,
gained deep insight into how our tools deliver value in practice, 
and become the go-to contact for the front-end team at Huron.
