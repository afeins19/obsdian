# Areas of Focus for Next Business Year

### Modernizing the Reporting Platform and Data Infrastructure
My primary focus for the upcoming year is to moderinize our reporting platform into a fully
automated, testable, and scalable solution. By designing a cohesive DB architecture 
and applying modern tools like airflow, dbt, and git we will see a dramatic increase
across our report output, data reliability, and development consistency. This modernization will also allow 
adhoc requests to be adressed much quicker through reusable models and data marts. Additionally, 
this approach will enable our reports to self-audit and proactively identify anomolies and alert our team. 

Beyond improving our output quality, this initiative will shift our department from manual reporting
to a fully automated and sustainable analytics framework. This will free our analysts to focus on interpretation, 
finding insights, and stretegic decision making rather than maintaining dashboards.
