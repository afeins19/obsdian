# Change Orders
change orders are tickets that require some significant amount of code changes that have reached the point of completion. Change orders outline what has been done through the service desk portal. 

**NOTE: CHANGE ORDERS ARE USUALLY DONE ON MONDAY, TUESDAY, AND WEDNESDAY** 
- this is done so that any potential issues can be fixed before the weekend 

### Creating a Change Order 
- CAB or NO CAB (use NO CAB for small changes that dont need large review)
- RFC status (Ready For Change) is the default status and will be used most often
- Assgnee
- Team name (ours is Corp Automation & Integration)
