## Previous Goals 

- Along with continuing to learn the android studio environment, I would like to start adding documentation to GitHub about the android studio development process. I will also include a small blurb about gradle as i just found out it is the tool which automatically gets dependencies one may need to run our program. I would also like to get through the next 2 sections of my Udemy course
## Key Points 
- Configured GitHub Projects Page for team based views with goals/milestones with Tyler 
- Created Documentation for Android Studio Views ViewGroups (will upload to teams)
- Learned That basically no service whatsoever allows you to get prices/data from an api...must use another form of data collection 
## Next Week Goals
- write unit tests for UI Activities 
- collaborate with UI team to create a standardized layout for our app to be shared among activities 
- look into location data for our app (with Syed)
